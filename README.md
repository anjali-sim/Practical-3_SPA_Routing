## Single Page Application Using Routing
A single page application is a website or web application that dynamically rewrites a current web page with new data
from the web server, instead of the default method of a web browser loading entire new pages.
For this, I have developed a website of furniture which contains four tabs - Home, Services, About Us and Contact Us.
It also contains an image slider. Clicking on any particular tab takes us to that specific tabs content.
I have made a Single Page Application using two methods. One by using ID and another using the URL Routing.
In  URL Routing, I have tried it using two different methods, one with URL Routing and other with a combination of 
URL routing and loading HTML files via JavaScript.
In this Repository, I have made the Single Page Application using a combination of URL Routing and loading HTML files via JavaScript.
Using this method, only a particular tabs content will be displayed.

## Different ways of making a Single Page Application
<p><strong>1. By using ID : </strong>We can give a particular section an ID and pass that ID to the anchor tag in the navigation bar.</p>
<p><strong>2. By URL Routing : </strong>URL routing uses the URL path to map the route to the appropriate content or component. With URL routing, each route 
corresponds to a unique URL path, which makes it easy to share links to specific pages or content. For example, in a blog application, 
the URL path "/blog/post-1" would correspond to the blog post with the ID of "post-1".</p>
<p><strong>3. By Hash Routing : </strong>Hash routing, also known as fragment routing, uses the hash symbol (#) in the URL to map the route to the appropriate 
content or component. The hash portion of the URL is not sent to the server, so it can be used to store application state without triggering a 
page reload.</p>

## Features of the Practical :
<p>1. I have made the website Responsive which means the web pages look good on all devices.</p>
<p>2. I have also integrated a bottom to top button by which, on clicking it, it scrolls to the top of the page.</p>
<p>3. The website is User-friendly which means it is easy to navigate.</p>
